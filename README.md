# Suggested tools
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) -- very good editor for TypeScript files
- [nodejs & npm](https://nodejs.org) -- nodejs runs JavaScript outside the browser, and npm manages
third-party modules.

# How to run
 1. `npm install` installs the third-party modules that are depended upon by the project.
 2. `npm start` starts a private server that hosts the project as a web page.

# How to publish
 1. `npm run build` builds the project into a final web page.
 2. Zip everything in the `build` folder and upload it to itch.io.
